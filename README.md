The goal of this project is to create a 3D game using raycasting. The project involves creating a window with SDL2, implementing raycasting to draw walls, and allowing for camera angle adjustments.
You have a link 🔗 to a very good and very long tutorial about raycasting in the 👉 Tips and links. ../ section in the README.md file.
Please have a lot of fun Exploring this project ! 😄😁😀
Deployment
Installation Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/laabk/Maze_Project.git
cd alx-maze_project
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -o *.c maze
./maze
NOTE: you might experience challenges running the executable file if your container does not support SDL2 e.g No Video Device Found, so stick to a more suitable IDE like Visual Studio.

Usage
Run the compiled executable and enjoy the 3D game experience.
